# PetPics :cat::dog:

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 14.0.4.

## Random Animal Pictures

In this very simple SPA you'll find many cute pictures of random animals made available by the following public APIs (buy them a beer :stuck_out_tongue:): 

> [Cat as a service](https://cataas.com/#/)
>
> [Dog Api (Dog CEO)](https://dog.ceo/dog-api/)

It was created as a means to practice the Angular skills I learned on Santander Bootcamp Fullstack Developer, offered through the DIO platform. And as always, I'll try to make it better in the future as I get better at coding. 

You are free to give out suggestions on how to improve it, it'll be much appreciated :)
